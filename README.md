OUR PRODUCT
Our product name is Automated Thermal Scanner(ATS).This Product is used in public transport systems . It reads the temperature of the passengers trying to get inside the bus. If a person has high temperature , a red light will blink with a sound giving a warning that the passenger has  fever. Our device also gives the count of number of passengers inside the bus . This number will be displayed on front of the bus. The people at the busstop can see this number and may or may not get in depending upon the number . The thermal scanner will be fitted on top of the door and will be tilted in such a way that it can check the temperature of the person .
